## Overview

**KvDeveloper Client** is your mobile companion for hot-reloading **Kivy apps**‚Äîdesigned to give developers a lightning-fast preview and live-edit experience, directly on Mobile devices.

Inspired by the **Expo Go** workflow for React Native, this tool lets you:

- Start a dev server from any Kivy app directory.
- Instantly **load your app on mobile** via QR code or Server URL.
- Get **real-time updates** with automatic file watching.
- Skip USB cables, installs, and tedious builds.

Whether you're tweaking UI layouts or debugging logic, this workflow keeps you moving fast and focused.

## Features

- Zero-install app preview on mobile.
- Server-to-client sync via HTTP & QR code.
- Hot-reload on file changes (KV, Python).
- Clean UI with simple connection steps.
- Safe and secure local access with opt-in controls.
